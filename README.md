# Fiori Flashcard Application

Taking inspiration from the app-ideas github, Implement a flashcard application
using SAPui5, CAP, and ui5 Web Components for React.

## Developing

React apps were created using `create-react-app`.

Run the app locally by running `npm run start:all`.

### TODO

Outstanding application features:

- [ ] Get the app configured for deployment to SAP BTP using Cloud Foundry.
  - [ ] Deploy using an MTA.
- [ ] Allow for filtering of flashcards based on `Topic`.
- [ ] Ability to add a new answer to the Flashcard when creating a new one.
